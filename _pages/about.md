I am a Senior Research Fellow of the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-statistical-sciences/) of [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). In 2021 I joined the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/) department of UCL to develop my own research project about: ''Inference for High-Dimensional and Functinonal Data''. Previously I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) of the University of Cambridge. Before that I did my PhD about ''Statistical learning methods for functional data with applications to prediction, classification and outlier detection'' at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/UC3MInstitucional/en/PortadaMiniSiteA/1371229065435/Department_of_Statistics) at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

My main research is oriented to develop statisical and machine learning methods to tackle inferential problems in high-dimensional and functional data over different fields such as: energy, economics, the environment, demography, business, finance, health and genetics. I have mainly focused on predictive confidence bands for functional time series; domain selection and classification in the Functional Data context; and outlier detection for stochastic processes using Information Theory tools. For more details, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=6IZOUNkAAAAJ) profile.

I am a member of the [International Association of Statistical Computing (IASC)](https://iasc-isi.org/), the [Bernoulli Society](https://www.bernoullisociety.org/) and the [European Network for Business and Industrial Statistics (ENBIS)](https://enbis.org/). I am currently leading the HDFD group, a space of interaction and discussion about High-Dimesional and Functional Data. If you want to collaborate giving a talk or discussing a topic drop me an [email](mailto:n.hernandez@ucl.ac.uk).
