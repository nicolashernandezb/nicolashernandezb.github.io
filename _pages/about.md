I am a [Lecturer in Statistics](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/hernandezn.html) within the Data Science, Statistics and Probability Centre at the [the School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/). My main research is oriented to develop statistical and machine learning methods to tackle inferential problems in high-dimensional and functional data over different fields such as: energy, economics, the environment, demography, business, finance, health and genetics. I have mainly focused on predictive confidence bands for functional time series; domain selection and classification in the Functional Data context; and outlier detection for stochastic processes using Information Theory tools. For more details, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=6IZOUNkAAAAJ) profile.

I just joined QMUL after spending 2 years as a Senior Research Fellow within the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-statistical-sciences/) at the [Department of Statistical Science, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/). Previously I was appointed as a PDRA at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) of the University of Cambridge. Before that I did my PhD about ''Statistical learning methods for functional data with applications to prediction, classification and outlier detection'' at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/UC3MInstitucional/en/PortadaMiniSiteA/1371229065435/Department_of_Statistics) of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

I am a member of the [Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS)]([https://iasc-isi.org/](https://imstat.org/)), the [International Association of Statistical Computing (IASC)](https://iasc-isi.org/), the [Bernoulli Society](https://www.bernoullisociety.org/) and the [European Network for Business and Industrial Statistics (ENBIS)](https://enbis.org/). I am currently leading the HDFD group, a space of interaction and discussion about High-Dimesional and Functional Data. If you want to collaborate giving a talk or discussing a topic drop me an [email](mailto:n.hernandez@ucl.ac.uk).
