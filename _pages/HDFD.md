**Group profile**

The High Dimensional and Functional Data Group is a research group based in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). In the era of Big Data, the statistical community has been paying increasing attention to the development of new techniques and methods involving the analysis of complex data. Data expressed in high dimensions, or even infinite (as the case of functional data) are becoming more and more available due to major advances in data collection technology. 

Nowadays, almost all the classical multivariate methodologies have been extended to a high dimensional or functional framework, such as: dimension reduction; semi-parametric and nonparametric regression; classification and clustering; distance and depth measures; regularization; analysis of dependent data, among others.

The high dimensional and functional data umbrella involves different statistical approaches such as Bayesian Inference and Machine Learning, and it spans many fields of research: economics, finance, genetics, environment, among others.

**Objectives**

The main objective is to create an informal platform for interaction, discussion and learning about high dimensional and functional data, where we can go beyond a formal seminar series.

The group’s activities revolve around the interaction and discussion of day-to-day work of the group members; work in progress presentations; discussion and presentation of open research questions and ideas; and it operates as a reading group as well.

**When and where?**

We meet on Mondays, on a fortnightly basis. The group meetings are via Zoom. If you are interested in joining, contact Nicolás Hernández. Additionally, you can subscribe to our mailing list here.
