**Objectives**

The main objective is to have an informal platform for interaction, discussion and learning about high dimensional and functional data, where we can go beyond a formal seminar series. 

The groupâ€™s activities revolve around the interaction and discussion of day-to-day work of the group members; work in progress presentations; discussion and presentation of open research questions and ideas; and it operates as a reading group as well.

**When and where?**

We meet on Mondays 15:00 UK time (flexible) on a monthly basis. The group meetings are via Zoom. If you are interested in joining [email me](mailto:n.hernandez@ucl.ac.uk) to join our mailing list.
